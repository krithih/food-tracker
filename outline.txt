Great choice! Here’s a beginner-friendly breakdown of how you can build an AI-Powered Food Waste Tracker for the Girls Who Code AI + Sustainability Challenge.

🌱 Project: AI-Powered Food Waste Tracker
🚀 Idea Summary
A mobile or web app where users scan grocery receipts, and AI predicts food expiration dates while suggesting recipes and donation options to reduce food waste.

🔑 Key Features
Scan Grocery Receipts 📸

Users upload a picture of their receipt.
AI extracts item names using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Predict Expiration Dates 🥦

The app estimates when each item will expire based on typical shelf life.
Users receive reminders before food goes bad.
Suggest Ways to Use Food 🍽️

AI recommends recipes based on food that’s about to expire.
Encourage Donations ❤️

If users don’t plan to eat something, the app suggests nearby food banks or community fridges.
🧠 How AI is Integrated
🔍 1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Receipt Scanning
What it does: Converts text from receipt images into editable text.
How to implement it: Use Google Cloud Vision API or Tesseract OCR (open-source).
📊 2. Machine Learning for Expiration Prediction
What it does: Uses a predefined dataset of food shelf-life to estimate when an item will go bad.
How to implement it: Create a database with common foods and their average expiration times (e.g., "Milk: 7 days after purchase").
🍽️ 3. Recipe Recommendation with AI
What it does: Suggests recipes using ingredients the user has.
How to implement it: Use an API like Spoonacular to generate recipes based on available ingredients.
